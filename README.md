Game Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing workflow applied to a videogame sales dataset. The notebook, game scales.ipynb, walks through data loading, statistical analysis, missing value treatment, outlier detection, feature encoding, and data visualization.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand the structure of a game sales dataset and prepare it for future machine learning tasks.
The notebook includes:

Importing necessary Python libraries

Reading and inspecting the dataset

Performing descriptive and statistical analysis

Handling missing values and duplicate rows

Detecting and treating outliers

Checking skewness and kurtosis

Visualizing numerical and categorical variables

Applying Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding

This project is useful for anyone learning data cleaning, feature engineering, or basic EDA using Python.
